	</header>

		<div class="advice">
			<h4>Resources are your friends!</h4>
			<p>Read once, do once, watch someone else do, do again, read again. That's how to learn.</p>

			<p>Dig up good resources! Make a developer friend, favorite the ws3 site, and search, search, search!</p>

			<h4>Motivation plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>Mistakes happen. In fact, it's guaranteed. </p>

			<p>It's ok to be frustrated. But you can fix it. Even when you delete all your files and didn't have backups, re-writing your code is MUCH faster the second time around! And you learn to back-up everything frequently! </p>

			<p>Just remember why you wanted to do this in the first place...Better job? More security? The ability to make your own site? Whatever it is, it's worth it!</p>
